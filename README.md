# Hi there 👋 I'm Tenal! (she/her)


## Frontend Developer 

I recently transitioned into the wonderful world of web development following a year of career exploration. While my road to web dev has been a winding one, I am beyond excited to finally be a frontend developer! I'm ready to build, break, repair, and update some exciting applications, so let's [get in touch](https://calendly.com/tenalbourchier)!

## Tenal's Projects

    💻 I'm currently working on:   
         • Updating my portfolio & old projects (it's a never ending cycle)
         • My React.js skills (bring it on, hooks)      
   
    📖 I'm currently learning:   
         • Vanilla JavaScript (I learned jQuery first)   
         • Computer Science fundamentals (thanks to Harvard's CS50x course)   
   
    🌟 Next, I'll be learning:   
         • Vue.js (the more JavaScript frameworks, the better)
         • Redux (once I'm more familiar with react hooks)

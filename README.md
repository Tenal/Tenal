# Hi there 👋 I'm [Tenal](https://tenalbourchier.com/)! (she/her)


## Frontend Developer 

I'm an inquisitive front-end developer with a background in marketing and law that allows me to excel at communicating, analytical reasoning, and creative problem-solving. I take pride in building and improving dynamic user interfaces through clean, well-documented, responsive, and accessible code. If you're excited by the prospect of working with me to build, break, repair, and improve some exciting applications, let's [get in touch](https://calendly.com/tenalbourchier)!

## Tenal's Projects

    💻 I'm currently working on: 
        
         • Updating my portfolio & old projects (it's a never ending cycle)
         • My React.js skills (bring it on, hooks)      
   
    📖 I'm currently learning: 
        
         • Vanilla JavaScript (I learned jQuery first)   
         • Computer Science fundamentals (thanks to Harvard's CS50x course)   
   
    🌟 Next, I want to learn:  
        
         • Vue.js (the more JavaScript frameworks, the better)
         • Redux (once I'm more familiar with react hooks)

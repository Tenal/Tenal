# Hi, I'm [Tenal](https://tenalbourchier.com/)! (she/her)


## Software Developer 

I'm an inquisitive software developer (specializing in front-end development) located in Vaughan, Canada. I have over 4 years of comprehensive experience in cleantech startups across the full software development lifecycle - architecting, developing, testing, deploying, documenting, and maintaining complex applications. I'm proficient in the MERN stack and Agile methodologies, with a proven track record of refactoring legacy code, reducing technical debt, and implementing modern design strategies that enhance performance and quality. With a background in marketing and law, I'm adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams and effectively communicating complex concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

I'm currently searching for my next software role, let's [get in touch](https://calendly.com/tenalbourchier)!
